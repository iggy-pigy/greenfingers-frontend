        <p>
            <span className="first-word">GreenFingers</span> is the place where you can easily swap your plants, give them away and connect with other plant lovers. If you are the same as me and would like to update your plant collection but don't want to spend a lot of money, then this is the right place for YOU! I tried to make the page as simple as possible. In the section ‘Plants Available’ you can see newly added plants which are looking for a new home. Via our page you can see plants, read descriptions and contact the owner by using their provided e-mail address. If you want to give away your plant, simply fill out the form which you will find in section ME2U.
